Welcome to PyCorn!
------------------
Summary:
PyCorn is a python pipeline based on scikit-learn neural network library. The ultimate goal of PyCorn is 
to locate potential Transcription Start Site (TSS) according to our pre-trained neural network model.
Usage: 
$ python pycorn.py  -i <input file>  -o <output file>  -w <window slide size> 

*note: if no parameters are supplied the testInputSmall test data will be used with a window size of 100. This test data simulates a small genomic sequence. Default result will be saved to testResult.txt

Arguments: 
input file -  The path of fasta file containing genomic sequence to be identified 
output file - The path of output text file that will be responsible to store the TSS scanning result.
window slide size - Default is 400. PyCorn will use pre-trained model to predict TSS by looking into
nucleotides In order words, if you want to scan every nucleotide on the sequence,
please set it to 1.
