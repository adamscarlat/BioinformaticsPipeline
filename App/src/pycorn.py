	print "Arguments: "
	print "		input file -  The path of fasta file containing genomic sequence to be identified "
	print "		output file - The path of output text file that will be responsible to store the TSS scanning result."
	print "		window slide size - Default is 400. PyCorn will use pre-trained model to predict TSS by looking into"
